########################

drifttest-Evaluation is a set of R scripts to evaluate the performance of the temporal genome scan implemented in drifttest (doi:10.5281/zenodo.1194663). It simulates (via SLiM 1.8) population genetic data from a population sampled twice at two different times and runs drifttest on the simulated sample.

These scripts are distributed for replicability of the results from the work "Power and limits of selection genome scans on temporal data from a selfing population" by Miguel Navascués, Arnaud Becheler, Laurène Gay, Joëlle Ronfort, Karine Loridon and Renaud Vitalis doi:10.1101/2020.05.06.080895. However, note that these scripts use SLiM version 1.8. More recent versions of SLiM (>=2.0) include a scripting language that allows to do, in a more efficient way, some of the simulation features used in drifttest-Evoluation. For uses other than the replication of results from our article we strongly recommend using the latest version of SLiM.

* Executable file for SLiM 1.8
